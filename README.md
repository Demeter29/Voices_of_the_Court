# Voices of the Court

Voices of the Court is a Crusader kings 3 mod that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into the gameplay. It lets you hold conversations with the characters and also impact the game state to an extend.

## How does it work?

The mod extracts the necessary game information from ck3, converts them into prompts for the llms and and creates a chat for you with the selected character.

## How does it impact the game state?

We impact the game with Actions. These are predefined game effects that gets triggered when the llm thinks it should. Only the predefined actions will get triggered, the llm can't make these actions on their own.
